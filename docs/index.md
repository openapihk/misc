API specifications from various industries and government agencies in Hong Kong. As you may know, there has been a growing push towards open data and open APIs in Hong Kong, driven by the need for greater transparency and accessibility in government and industry.

While the Hong Kong government has made significant strides in opening up data to the public, many of the APIs being used are not following the OpenAPI Specification 3.0. This may be due to legacy systems or other technical limitations, but it presents a challenge for developers who want to build applications that can consume these APIs.

This is where our organization comes in. By hosting OpenAPI specifications for these APIs, we can help bridge the gap between the legacy systems and modern development practices. OpenAPI provides a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and consume them. By adopting OpenAPI standards, we can improve the interoperability and accessibility of these APIs, and help accelerate innovation and progress in Hong Kong.

We welcome contributions from anyone who shares our vision of a more open and connected Hong Kong. Whether you are a developer, a data scientist, or a member of the public interested in open data, we invite you to join our community and help us build a more transparent and inclusive ecosystem for data and services in Hong Kong. Together, we can create a brighter future for all.

## Why Open API Specification 3.0

API Specification 3.0 (also known as OpenAPI 3.0) is a widely-used standard for describing RESTful APIs. There are several reasons why this specification is popular and why you might want to use it:

1. Improved documentation: OpenAPI 3.0 provides a standardized way to document RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand how to use them and integrate them into their applications.
2. Interoperability: By using a common specification, APIs can be more easily integrated with other systems, making it easier for developers to build applications that use multiple APIs.
3. Code generation: Many tools are available for generating code from OpenAPI 3.0 specifications, which can save developers time and reduce the likelihood of errors.
4. Testing: Testing tools can use OpenAPI 3.0 specifications to automatically generate test cases, which can help ensure that APIs are working correctly.
5. Standardization: OpenAPI 3.0 is an open standard, which means that it is not controlled by any single vendor or organization. This makes it more likely to be widely adopted and supported in the long term.
