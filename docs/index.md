specifications from various industries and government agencies in Hong Kong. As you may know, there has been a growing push towards open data and open APIs in Hong Kong, driven by the need for greater transparency and accessibility in government and industry.

While the Hong Kong government has made significant strides in opening up data to the public, many of the APIs being used are not following the OpenAPI Specification 3.0. This may be due to legacy systems or other technical limitations, but it presents a challenge for developers who want to build applications that can consume these APIs.

This is where our organization comes in. By hosting OpenAPI specifications for these APIs, we can help bridge the gap between the legacy systems and modern development practices. OpenAPI provides a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and consume them. By adopting OpenAPI standards, we can improve the interoperability and accessibility of these APIs, and help accelerate innovation and progress in Hong Kong.

We welcome contributions from anyone who shares our vision of a more open and connected Hong Kong. Whether you are a developer, a data scientist, or a member of the public interested in open data, we invite you to join our community and help us build a more transparent and inclusive ecosystem for data and services in Hong Kong. Together, we can create a brighter future for all.
